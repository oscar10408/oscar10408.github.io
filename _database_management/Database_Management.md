**Description**  
This project involves designing and implementing a relational database schema for a social media platform inspired by Facebook. It encompasses the creation of tables, enforcement of data integrity through constraints, and development of SQL scripts for schema creation and data management.

- Designed an ER diagram to model entities such as users, friendships, messages, photos, and events
- Implemented SQL scripts to create and manage database objects, ensuring referential integrity
- Developed views and queries to facilitate data retrieval and analysis
- Included scripts for loading sample data and dropping database objects for maintenance

**Description**  
This project demonstrates how to migrate relational data to a NoSQL system and perform analytical queries using **MongoDB**.  
It showcases data extraction from Oracle, transformation into JSON, and aggregation queries to reveal user and friendship patterns.

- Extracted user data from Oracle and transformed it into MongoDB-compatible JSON documents  
- Imported data into **MongoDB** and structured collections based on users, friendships, and cities  
- Performed queries to analyze friend counts, restore broken friendships, and extract birth month distributions  
- Applied MongoDB’s **aggregation framework** for efficient data grouping and statistical analysis  
- Demonstrates practical skills in **data migration**, **NoSQL modeling**, and **query design**
